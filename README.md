I am knowledgable with utilizing clearinghouse systems such as ClaimRemedi and Waystar for claim batching, troubleshoot clearinghouse rejections and analysis of claim status. I also have experience with pulling revenue and aging reports utilizing IBM eBO software. I do have an interest learning more skills such as in robotic process automation field; while assisting with the Robotic Process Automation Department within Medcor and have taken and completed two certificates with UiPath RPA software as well continued education on programming and coding related to Automation such as Python.
 
Another recent skill developed is training with new staff and offshore teams to become more familiar with the client facility's eClinical Works and Clearinghouse systems and how to reprocess AR related tasks such as Insurance Rejected and claim denials.
 
 
Quality of Work
 
 
I will consistently try my best in producing high-quality work by maintaining attention to detail, organization, and timely task completion. I apply critical thinking and research skills to resolve claim issues effectively and support process improvement. I’ve also helped train new staff and offshore teams to navigate our systems and workflows; ensuring consistency and accuracy in AR reprocessing and denial management. In order to maintain a high quality of work performance for the offshore team, I have completed daily audits and provided issues and errors found with leadership and shared findings with offshore team. In addition, I currently work with the RPA team to ensure claims processed by the automation robot meets a required passing score via completing audit reports for evaluation of the robot performance. My goal is to continue growing my skill set and contributing to the overall success of the team.
 
 
Soft skills included attention to detail, critical analysis, research on issues for resolution opportunity, completion of tasks within a timely manner and provide communication with in-house team members, leadership team and offshore team.
